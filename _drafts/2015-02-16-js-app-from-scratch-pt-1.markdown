This is the first in a series of posts I'll be writing inspired by [my current personal project]({% post_url 2015-02-10-pet-projects-2015 %}), Soccer Slaturday. As I've been getting it set up, I've noticed that there a tonne of posts about npm, node, bower, grunt and configuring this **seperately** but very few about how to use them together, save for a section in the docs about how to install it using npm.

The first post in this series aims to fill that space, covering how, and why, I chose the tools I did, along with how I configured them to compliment each other, as opposed to just working together.
