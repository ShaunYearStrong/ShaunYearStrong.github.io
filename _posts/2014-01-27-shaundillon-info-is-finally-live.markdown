<p class="post__excerpt">You are your worst client.</p>

<section>

Anybody that knows me will know that I've been "working on my personal site" for a long time. And, while I have had various holding pages and temporary fixes live, I've never really had anything more stable in place.

A lot of this was down to the "designing for yourself" predicament I'm sure a lot of designers/developers can relate to. For those not familiar to this concept, designing your own site is the worst thing ever, and you are your worst client ever. You'll never be happy with "near enough", you're overly critical and as a result it ends up in limbo.

So, I decided: "What if I just get it live and work on the design in increments?". I'd get to practice continuous integration, and I'd finally have a site live. So that's what I did. Now, depending on when you're reading this, it could just be a bare bones Jekyll blog or something new and exciting.

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub pages][github-pages]. I'd also like to thank [Andy Taylor][andy-taylor] as this site would not exist without his [guide on installing Jekyll on Mac OSX][jekyll-guide].
