<p class="post__excerpt">The trials and tribulations of running your own website - One week on.</p>

Today officially marks one week since I finally got a site live [after years of thinking about it][first-post-link].

Here's what I've learned so far:

* It's a lot easier to motivate yourself to make small changes than it is to tackle everything at once.
* Don't worry if you don't get it right first time, nobody does.
* Experiment, experiment, experiment.

Well, I say that's all I've learned, but in truth I think the most useful thing I've taken on is confidence in using the command line and massive improvements in my personal workflow.

I've found that as it's my site, I'm not afriad of experimenting, trying new things out and learning them. If it's wrong, I'll fix it, it's not like I have anyone else to let down but myself.

These are all points that weren't too apparent to me coming in to making my site, but it seems the downsides of working for yourself can also been seen as upsides.

Here's to another week.
