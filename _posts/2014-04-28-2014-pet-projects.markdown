<p class="post__excerpt">I've finally taken some on, here's what I've learned so far.</p>

<section>

As I’ve become increasingly frustrated with the lack of challenges at my current job, I’ve been looking elsewhere for them, namely, pet projects.

Now, you may be saying “Why don’t you just find a new job?” well, I have, but that was a long process and I needed my fill as soon as possible.

So, in the short term I’ve created/collaborated on a few projects and it’s been a huge breath of fresh air. 
Not only am I pushing in all the areas I want, but I’m being given proper freedom to work on something that I feel motivated to work on, this is something I haven’t felt in a long time.

These projects will trickle out as and when I finish them, the closest to release being [Léon Ipsum]( http://www.leonipsum.com/ " Léon Ipsum").

I’ve had a huge amount of fun working on the few I have now, and I’m always looking for more, so [contact me]( mailto:shaun@shaundillon.info "contact me") if you’ve got something you’d like to collaborate on.
