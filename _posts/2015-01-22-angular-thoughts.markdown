<p class="post__excerpt">Thoughts, gripes and reflections so far</p>

<section>

While I've been quiet on my blog, I've been hard at work in my day job at [Tictrac](http://www.tictrac.com), becoming engrossed in the world on quantified self and app development.

I couldn't be happier with the position, I've got the freedom to learn, I work iteratively within a true dev team with correct procedures and, most importantly, I get to pitch, and use, up-to-date technologies. One of these being *AngularJS*.

Now, without going into too much detail, we're rebuilding the Tictrac product from the ground up and while it being a client-side application was a given, the framework we used was completely up in the air. After floating a few ideas, even writing a few small apps to familiarise ourselves, and executive decision was made to go with Angular.

A [lot of blog posts](https://medium.com/este-js-framework/whats-wrong-with-angular-js-97b0a787f903) have been flying around recently about the shortcomings of Angular (being locked in, two way binding having weird rules, performance issues, getting your site indexed) and while they all have a good point, it still serves the purposes we need it for.

The first thing I noticed was how ridiculously simple it was to go from my existing knowledge, to writing easy, dynamic pages with Angular, thinking with directives, the lovely two-way binding and relative ease of writing controllers, services and custom directives.

This was all great to begin with, but I've found as we've gone on, the site is become more and more convoluted, with reformats flying around left, right and centre. This may be a direct result of our strict, iterative, agile way of working.

In fact, when doing some research, I'd say what we've built so far is the largest example of an Angular app I've found.

Not all is lost though, with these problems comes new ways of learning, a better understanding for the framework and ultimately, more chance of getting it right first time. It's still early days after all, and the sheer amount I've learned in unbelievable.

For all it's shortcomings, Angular is simple, it's scalable and it's super well documented and supported by a vast community and because of all that, I love it.
