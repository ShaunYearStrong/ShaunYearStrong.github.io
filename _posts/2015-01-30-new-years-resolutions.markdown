<p class="post__excerpt">My aim for the year ahead</p>

<section>

The past year has been a roller coaster for me, going from being in a position I'd completely outgrown into the deep end with my current position. I've learned an amazing amount in the past 9 months or so, so I'm making this year is all about consolidation and moving into waters unknown.

What do I mean by "waters unknown" I hear you say? Well, as I've come through a more non-traditional developers path of starting in design then moving through to development, I haven't studied the fundamentals of computer science, I've just been picking them up along the way. As a result, I'm having to put in far more work than is necessary to work in various environments.

##My solution

So, what can I do to resolve this? Well, it's simple: **study a backend language**.

Let me explain: I've been working in javascript pretty much solid since I became a developer, while I've danced around with PHP and touched on Ruby in tutorials, these have served as nothing more than aids in learning the syntax. If I want to become a more rounded developer, I'm going to need to study <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> these things work.

I figured I'd need a point of reference for all this, so I'm going to stick with one language for the time being and that's going to be **Ruby**. Why Ruby? well, why not? The truth is, for now, it's just a case of <em>all my friends are doing it</em> which may be a terrible reason for taking up smoking, but it's an excellent reason to take up a new language. I'll have access to tonnes of support and honest critique whenever I need it.

If you started this post expecting a list, I apologise, but focusing on one thing is going to help me vastly, getting these fundamentals down is something I've been putting off for too long and now it's time to bite the bullet and consolidate myself as a true developer.
