<p class="post__excerpt">Making sense of what's on offer right now</p>

<section>

As with any knowledge based position, keeping your skills sharp is super important. Not only to make sure you don't fall behind, but to ensure you don't forget the basics in the first place.

Recently I've been smashing [Code wars](http://www.codewars.com/) for simple, logic based tasks but I wanted something a bit more substantial to tackle.

So, I asked around and a friend of mine sent me across an interview question they use for prospective developers.

<blockquote>
    Create an on-screen keyboard that:
    <ul>
        <li>behaves as a normal keyboard does (Paying particular attention to the caps lock and shift functionality)</li>
        <li>Is responsive</li>
        <li>Uses a JS framework of your choice</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

I loved the mix of a simple premise, with a lot of freedom around how you get there.

## Taking it further

That final point: "Uses a JS framework of your choice", got me thinking; What is the *right* choice?

That's a tough question to answer, surely all these frameworks are popular for some reason? I decided to find out, but first I had to define my criteria.

Everybody likes different frameworks for different reasons, whether it's responsiveness, ease of use, how extensive they are, how light they are etc. After some deliberation I decided on two, one user-centric, and one developer-centric: *performance* and *code simplicity*.

Performance is a given, when all is said and done, the end user is the most important person in all of this, it's who the app is made for and there's nothing more frustrating than a sluggish, unresponsive application.

Code simplicity was a harder one to come to, but it's something I feel applies to all of these frameworks. If you boil down what they're trying to achieve, it's making it easier for developers to write applications in the first place.

## The project

You can see my progress so far (and fork / comment on it) on my [Github repo](https://github.com/ShaunYearStrong/framework-keyboards).

I'll be adding new posts for each completed framework along with a case study and a final wrap up as and when they're finished.
