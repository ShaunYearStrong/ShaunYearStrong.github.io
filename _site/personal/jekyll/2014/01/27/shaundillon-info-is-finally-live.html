<p>Anybody that knows me will know that I&#39;ve been &quot;working on my personal site&quot; for a long time, about two years to be precise. And, while I have had various holding pages and temporary fixes live, I&#39;ve never really had anything more stable in place.</p>

<p>A lot of this was down to the &quot;designing for yourself&quot; predicament I&#39;m sure a lot of designers/developers can relate to. For those not familiar to this concept, designing your own site is the worst thing ever, and you are your worst client ever. You&#39;ll never be happy with &quot;near enough&quot;, you&#39;re overly critical and as a result it ends up in limbo.</p>

<p>So, I decided: &quot;What if I just get it live and work on the design in increments?&quot;. I&#39;d get to practice continuous integration, and I&#39;d finally have a site live. So that&#39;s what I did. Now, depending on when you&#39;re reading this, it could just be a bare bones Jekyll blog or something new and exciting, but know it started out looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/post-images/2014/jan/2014-01-27-screenshot.png" alt="ShaunDillon.info v1"></p>

<p>This site is built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. I&#39;d also like to thank [Andy Taylor][http://andytaylor.me/] as this site would not exist without his <a href="http://andytaylor.me/2012/11/03/installing-ruby-and-jekyll/">guide on installing Jekyll on Mac OSX</a>. </p>
