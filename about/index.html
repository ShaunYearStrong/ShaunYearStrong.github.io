  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Ahoy-hoy! I'm Shaun, a front-end developer based in London, in the UK.</p>
  <p>I currently work for <strong>Alpari UK</strong> as a front end developer, tasked with the build and maintenance of their global sites. This job has been by far my most formative, taking me from my beginnings as a barely functioning website administrator to being charged with, and commended for succeeding in, expanding the companies portfolio of sites to a truly global scale.</p>
  <p>But, enough about my job. I'm hugely passionate about the web, always learning, experimenting, pushing new ideas and wanting to progress.</p>
