    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Ahoy-hoy! I'm Shaun, a front-end developer based in London, in the UK.</p>
    <p>I currently work for <strong>Tictrac</strong> as a front end developer on the Tictrac platform. I work day to day with scalable, OOJS using AngularJS and specialise in SCSS architecture for large sites. I'm often found annoying people in pull request comments on Github pointing out missing newlines or spaces, or down the road drinking a strong soya flat white and scouring blogs.</p>
